# FreecodecampChallenges
free code camp challenges repo

## Reason

I created this repo to allow me to use git while participating in freecodecamp.
I've also noticed that I'm more productive using local tools (nodemon, yi/vim, node repl)
instead of completing the challenges on the codepen or the freecodecamp website.

## Structure

Each project will have it own folder containing a separate file for html, css, and javascript.
The code challenges will be in the challenges folder and will only include some of the challenges.
